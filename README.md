# PolarNotes

PolarNotes is a simple, yet efficient plugin to write your own notes in. It's extremely simple to use. You are able to write and delete your notes from a menu, which is seperate for each individual player. PolarNotes has only one command - /notes, it opens notes menu.

PolarNotes has been tested on 1.16 and 1.17 versions, using lower versions might not be viable and might break a plugin!
